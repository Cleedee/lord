Since he did wipe out an entire dwarf army when he conquered Erebor, it seems fitting that Smaug be capable of doing this in the game as well. Also, because Smaug is pretty much the only enemy in the scenario (aside from a few small birds), it is important that he be able to attack more than just one time each round.\nIf it's any comfort, we play-tested that scenario extensively and even did a mathematical analysis of how often Smaug will attack on average. While he's capable of making more than 3 attacks in a single combat phase, it's not that likely. Of course there's no accounting for luck.\nI have made a note to include some additional information about shadow cards in the next FAQ.",
